# James Jarman – Data Analyst Portfolio

Welcome to my data analytics portfolio. I am **James Jarman**, a First-Class Mathematics graduate with a passion for uncovering insights through data. This repository is a collection of self-driven projects designed to demonstrate my technical skills and analytical thinking, developed through independent study and professional certification programmes.

Whether you are a recruiter, hiring manager, or fellow data enthusiast—thank you for visiting. Feel free to explore the projects below.

## Projects

### 1. [Project – Bank Transactions](https://github.com/jameslboro/james-jarman-portfolio/tree/main/project-Bank-Transactions) *(In Progress)*  
**Tools:** Python, Pandas, Seaborn, Plotly, Jupyter Notebooks  
**Dataset:** Kaggle – [Bank Transaction Dataset for Fraud Detection](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/valakhorasani/bank-transaction-dataset-for-fraud-detection)

This project explores customer banking transactions to identify trends and behaviours. It includes thorough exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature exploration, and insightful visualisations. Currently being written up for final conclusions and presentation.

### 2. [Project – US Candy Distributor](https://github.com/jameslboro/james-jarman-portfolio/tree/main/project-US-Candy-Distributor)
**Tools:** SQL (T-SQL), Microsoft SQL Server, Power BI  
**Dataset:** Maven Analytics – [US Candy Distributor](https://mavenanalytics.io/data-playground?order=date_added%2Cdesc&search=US%20Candy%20Distributor)

This project simulates operations for a fictional US-based candy distributor. The data was cleaned and transformed in SQL, then visualised in a multi-page Power BI report to explore sales, logistics, and factory performance across regions. One of the more developed projects—currently refining visuals and DAX calculations.

### 3. [Project – Air Quality Analysis](https://github.com/jameslboro/james-jarman-portfolio/tree/main/project-Air-Quality) *(In Progress)*  
**Tools:** Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn  
**Dataset:** Kaggle – [Global Air Quality Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/waqi786/global-air-quality-dataset/)

An early-stage project analysing environmental data. Initial cleaning and visualisations are complete, with further analysis, correlation investigation, and potential predictive modelling to follow.

## About Me

I am a recent graduate (July 2024) from **Loughborough University**, where I achieved First Class Honours in Mathematics. Alongside my degree, I have undertaken hands-on technical training through certifications from IBM and Microsoft, and built this portfolio to showcase my skills in practice.

While I am currently exploring different sectors, I have deliberately selected projects across **finance, operations, and environmental data** to demonstrate adaptability and a strong willingness to learn.

My previous work experience in the property sector allowed me to apply data-driven thinking to real-world business operations, which now informs my approach to analytical problem-solving.
