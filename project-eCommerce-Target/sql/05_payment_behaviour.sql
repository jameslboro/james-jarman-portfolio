Overview:
This section analyses customer payment behaviour, including preferred payment types, average instalment durations, and revenue contribution from different payment methods using data from the 'target_ecommerce' schema.

-- Question 15: What are the most commonly used payment types by state or customer segment?
-- ================================================

-- Most commonly used payment types by state

-- Question 16: Whatâ€™s the average instalment plan length for orders by value or category?
-- ================================================

-- Average instalments by order value segment

-- Question 17: How much revenue is coming from instalment payments vs upfront?
-- ================================================
