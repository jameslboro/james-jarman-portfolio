- i used the following theme: https://community.fabric.microsoft.com/t5/Themes-Gallery/Financial-Dashboard/td-p/2444455
- there is a typo for one product in the products and sales tables
	- first let us update this, using sql query: update_candy_products.sql
- after working with analysing data, it is noted that there are duplicates across the order id column, however they are not immediate duplicates as it seems there are different amounts for the number of units sold and hence the sales and profit columns. this could be due to Partial shipments or line item breakdowns: Sometimes, a single order ID might be split into multiple order lines (e.g., different package sizes, partial fulfilments). for this reason, we will not remove duplicates based on order id, but based on the entire row, for example: Order ID US-2024-104731-CHO-FUD-51000 has 5 entries, two of them match exactly so we will remove this duplicate, but keep the 4 entries.
	- as a result this trims the number of rows down from 10,194 to 9,881
	- number of orders will be aggregated as a distinct count.
- for sales performance analysis we will use all orders, but for analysis to do with shipping we will only use the orders made in the united states
	- hence removing the 200 orders to Canada - this is because we do not have the zip codes for Canada
- for shipping analysis we will also remove ALL duplicates fom the order-id column, leaving only 8,389 orders (US only and no duplicates on order_id column)
- when creating the map visuals (limited power bi subscription - hence had to use python visuals)
