    "## Project Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "- Identify **top-performing products and divisions** by revenue and profitability.\n",
    "- Analyse **average shipping distances** from factories to customers.\n",
    "- Determine **regional sales trends** to guide geographic strategy.\n",
    "- Visualise data to support strategic decisions using **Power BI dashboards**.\n",

    "## Process & Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Ingestion\n",
    "- Loaded all `.csv` datasets into SQL Server.\n",
    "- Cleaned and transformed data via SQL scripts.\n",
    "  - Fixed data inconsistencies (e.g., product name typos).\n",
    "  - Removed duplicates by grouping on `order_id` and aggregating metrics.\n",
    "  - Dropped `row_id` and unnecessary columns.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Cleaning & Filtering\n",
    "- Final cleaned dataset reduced to **8,549 orders**.\n",
    "- For **shipping distance analysis**, only **U.S. orders** were retained (8,389 rows) due to missing Canadian location data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Modelling\n",
    "- Created star schema in Power BI with relationships between fact and dimension tables.\n",
    "- Built custom DAX measures (e.g., total revenue, average distance).\n",
    "- Used **Import Mode** for optimal performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Star Schema Diagram\n",
    "![Star Schema](./data/star_schema.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Visualisations\n",
    "- Created report pages per key question.\n",
    "- Python visuals used for customer-factory distance mapping (due to Power BI subscription limits).\n",
    "- Custom slicers added for user interactivity (e.g., Region, Division, Year).\n",
